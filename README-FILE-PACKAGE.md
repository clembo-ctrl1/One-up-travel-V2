## 🔐 IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:

The **firebase-config.js** file contains YOUR Firebase API keys. This is SAFE because:
- ✅ Firebase security rules protect your data
- ✅ API keys are meant to be public (they identify your project)
- ✅ Your security rules prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ Only logged-in users can access their own data

**However, NEVER commit:**
- ❌ Private keys
- ❌ Secret tokens
- ❌ Admin SDK credentials

(You don't have any of these, so you're fine!)
