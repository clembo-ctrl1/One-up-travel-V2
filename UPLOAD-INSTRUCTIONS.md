- All links have been updated to match

**Old Files to DELETE:**
- ❌ `index-layla.html` (replaced with `index.html`)
- ❌ `itinerary-layla.html` (replaced with `itinerary.html`)

**Keep These Files:**
- ✅ All documentation (.md files)
- ✅ All JavaScript files
- ✅ Logo

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

**Problem: "404 Not Found"**
- Make sure you uploaded `index.html` (not `index-layla.html`)
- Check file names are exactly as listed above

**Problem: "Navigation doesn't work"**
- Make sure you uploaded the updated files (not the old ones)
- Check that `auth-handler.js` is the new version

**Problem: "Vercel not updating"**
- Wait 1-2 minutes after GitHub upload
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
